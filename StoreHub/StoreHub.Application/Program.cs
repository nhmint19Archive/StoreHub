         * Dependency injection is a technique used to achieve inversion of control (IoC).
         * It decouples dependencies by providing them to the object, rather than having objects instantiate dependencies.
         * Testing also benefits from dependency injection. If we abstract dependencies behind an interface, during tests we can
         * develop mocks/stubs easily, enabling developers to test the target object without worrying about its dependencies.
         * Although not in the scope of this assignment, `IConsoleView` and `IConsoleInputHandler` are designed with this in mind.
         *
         * However, this means there still needs to be a component that handles the instantiation of a class and
         * construct objects in the correct order (for example if, component A depends on B, then B must be instantiated first).
         * Another complex issue would be the scope of created objects (singleton, scoped, etc.) but within this project,
         * the singleton scope is sufficient since objects are either designed to be so (`AppState` subclasses) or widely used by almost
         * every state (`IConsoleView` and `IConsoleInputHandler`).
         *
         * `ServiceCollection` is an implementation of the IoC container that addresses these issues.
         * It relieves developers from the manual construction of objects and managing their scope.
         * Instead, they can register objects and declare their required dependencies in the constructor.
         * The IoC container automatically resolves these dependencies at runtime.
         * Naturally, late-binding introduces the risk that unregistered dependencies may go unnoticed and result in runtime exceptions.
         * However, by conducting thorough code reviews and rigorous testing, the risk can be significantly mitigated.
